**1.3  Understanding Variables and Data Types**

**Your Character's Digital DNA**

Think of your RPG hero as having a bunch of hidden stats: strength, smarts, luck.  Inside your program, we store those stats inside variables! But not all stats are the same kind of thing, and that's where data types come in.

**Types of Data**

* **Strings (str):**  These are for words and sentences, anything inside quotation marks:
    ```python
    character_name = "Rowan" 
    hometown = "Oakheart Village"
    ```
* **Numbers:**  
    * **Integers (int):** Whole numbers for things like age or level. 
        ```python
        age = 22
        level = 1 
        ```
    * **Floating-point Numbers (float):** For decimals, like for calculating precise damage.
        ```python
        critical_hit_chance = 25.5  # A 25.5% chance!
        ```
* **Booleans (bool):**  Have only two values, `True` or `False`.  Useful for 'yes' or 'no' things.
    ```python
    is_on_quest = True 
    has_magic_amulet = False
    ```

**RPG Time: Setting Stats** 

Let's give your character some starting stats:

```python
strength = 10
dexterity = 8
intelligence = 12
```

* **Quick Tip:** The names you give your variables matter! Use ones that make sense for your game.

**Mini-Project: Show Your Stats**

Let's display a basic character sheet:

```python
print("Name:", character_name)
print("Strength:", strength)
print("Dexterity:", dexterity)
print("Intelligence:", intelligence)
```

**Important Notes** 

* **Computers are Literal:**  If you put quotes around a number, it becomes a string, not a number for math!
* **Mixing Things Up:**  Be careful trying to do math with strings ("5" + 2 doesn't work).  We'll learn how to fix this later.

**Next Up: We'll use these stats to make calculations, like how much damage your hero can do!**
