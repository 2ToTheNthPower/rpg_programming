**1.4  Basic Arithmetic Operations**

**Unlock Number-Crunching Power**

Now that your hero has stats, let's make those numbers do something! Using basic math inside your program lets you figure out all kinds of cool things.

**Your Math Toolbox**

* **Addition (+):**  Combine or increase things.
    ```python 
    total_gold = coins_found + treasure_value 
    ``` 
* **Subtraction (-):**  Take things away.
    ```python
    health_remaining = max_health - damage_taken 
    ```
* **Multiplication (*):**  Great for scaling up power.
    ```python
    sword_damage = 5 * strength  # A strong hero hits harder!
    ```
* **Division (/):**  Split things or calculate percentages.
    ```python
    experience_gained = monster_power / 2  
    ```

**Special Operators**

* **Integer Division (//):** Gives you only the whole number part of a division. 
    ```python
    potions_crafted = ingredients // 3  # Each potion needs 3 ingredients
    ```
* **Modulo (%):** Gives the remainder after division,  useful for checking if things are even or odd.
    ```python
    is_level_divisible_by_3 = level % 3 == 0  # Special power-up every 3 levels?
    ```
* **Exponentiation (**):** For raising numbers to powers. 
    ```python
    fireball_area = explosion_radius ** 2  # Bigger radius means bigger boom!
    ```

**RPG Challenge: Damage Calculation**

Let's figure out how hard your hero hits:

```python
base_damage = 8  # Their basic punch or weapon 
strength_bonus = strength // 4  # Strong characters get a bonus 
total_damage = base_damage + strength_bonus

print("Your character can do", total_damage, "damage!")
```

**Mini-Project: Enhance Your Stats**

*  Can you add a calculation for how much health your character has? (Maybe based on strength?)
*  Try calculating a critical hit chance based on a percentage!

**Remember**

*  **Order of Operations:** Your program follows math rules (think PEMDAS/BODMAS). Use parentheses `()` to be extra clear if needed.

**Next Time: We'll make decisions based on these calculations: "If hit points are zero, game over!"**
