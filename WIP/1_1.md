# Introduction to Variables and Data Types in Python

Welcome to the world of Python programming! In this lesson, we'll start building an RPG character generator by learning about variables and data types.

## Creating a Character

Let's begin by creating a character named Rowan. We'll define Rowan's basic attributes: name, age, height, and whether they can cast spells.

In programming, we use *variables* to store and reference values. Think of a variable as a container that holds a specific piece of information. We give each variable a name so that we can easily access and manipulate its value later.

Here's how we create variables for Rowan's attributes:

```python
name = "Rowan"
age = 25
height = 1.75
is_spellcaster = True
```

In these lines of code:
- `"Rowan"` is a string (text) value, which we assign to the variable `name`.
- `25` is an integer (whole number) value, which we assign to the variable `age`.
- `1.75` is a float (decimal number) value, which we assign to the variable `height`.
- `True` is a boolean (true/false) value, which we assign to the variable `is_spellcaster`.

These different types of values are called *data types* in programming. Understanding data types is crucial because they determine what operations we can perform on our variables.

## Addition vs. Concatenation

Before we start using our variables, let's take a moment to understand the difference between addition and concatenation.

When we use the `+` operator with numbers (integers or floats), it performs mathematical addition:

```python
result = 5 + 6
print(result)  # Output: 11
```

However, when we use `+` with strings, it concatenates (joins) them together:

```python
result = "5" + "6"
print(result)  # Output: "56"
```

Notice that concatenating the strings `"5"` and `"6"` results in the string `"56"`, not the number `11`.

Keep this distinction in mind as we move forward, because it will be important when we start combining variables of different data types.

## Using Variables

Now that we have Rowan's attributes stored in variables, let's use them to print some information about our character:

```python
print("Name: " + name)
print("Age: " + str(age))
print("Height: " + str(height) + " meters")
print("Can cast spells: " + str(is_spellcaster))
```

Output:
```
Name: Rowan
Age: 25
Height: 1.75 meters
Can cast spells: True
```

In these print statements, we use the `+` operator to join strings. Notice that we need to convert the non-string values (`age`, `height`, `is_spellcaster`) to strings using the `str()` function before concatenating them.  Just notice this for now.  We'll learn more about functions later.

## Updating Variables

One of the benefits of using variables is that we can easily update their values. Let's say it's Rowan's birthday, and they turn 26:

```python
age = age + 1
print("After their birthday, Rowan's age is " + str(age))
```

Output:
```
After their birthday, Rowan's age is 26
```

Here, we use the `+` operator to add 1 to Rowan's current age, and then assign the result back to the `age` variable.

Congratulations on completing this lesson on variables and data types! You're well on your way to building an amazing RPG character generator. Keep practicing and exploring these concepts, and soon you'll be a Python programming hero!

üìù **Mini-Project: Character Introduction**

1. Create variables for your own character's name, age, height, and a boolean attribute (e.g., `is_magical`).
2. Use string concatenation to print a sentence introducing your character, including their name and age.
3. It's your character's birthday! Increase their age by 1 and print a celebratory message.
4. Experiment with concatenating different combinations of strings and numbers, observing the results and thinking about the difference between addition and concatenation.
