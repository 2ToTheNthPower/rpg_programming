**Section 2: The Power of Repetition –  Loops for Persistence**

**Quests Have Many Steps, So Does Your Code**

Think about an RPG quest. It's rarely just "go talk to the king."  You might need to fight several monsters, gather ingredients, or solve puzzles along the way.  Loops let your code do something repeatedly until it reaches a goal.

**Types of Loops**

*  **`while` Loops: The 'Keep Going Until...' Loop**

   *  They run as long as a condition is True.
   *  Great for things you don't know exactly how many times you'll need to do.

   **Example: Simple Combat**

   ```python
   monster_health = 10
   while monster_health > 0:
        damage = int(input("You attack! How much damage do you do? "))
        monster_health -= damage  
        print("The monster has", monster_health, "health left.")
   print("You defeated the monster!")
   ```

* **`for` Loops: The 'Do This for Each Thing' Loop** 

   *  They run a specific number of times, or iterate over a list of things. 
   *  Useful when you know how many times to do something, or have a set to work with.

   **Example: Inventory Check**

   ```python
   inventory = ["rusty sword", "healing potion", "shiny gem"]
   for item in inventory: 
       print("You have:", item)
   ```

**RPG Applications**

* **Combat Rounds:** Use a `while` loop to continue the battle until either the player or the monster runs out of health.
* **Training Montage:** A `for` loop can simulate training sessions to increase stats ("For each day of training, strength increases by 1...")
* **Searching for Treasure:**  A `while` loop can keep asking the player to search different locations until they find the treasure.

**Escaping Loops: The `break` Keyword**

Sometimes you need to exit a loop before it would normally end. That's where `break` shines!

**Example:  Fleeing from Battle**

```python
while True:  # A loop that would normally run forever 
    action = input("Attack or attempt to flee? ")
    if action == "attack":
        # ... combat code ...
    elif action == "flee":
        print("You escape!")
        break  # Exits the loop
```

**More RPG Examples**

* **Potion Brewing:** A `while` loop keeps asking if you want to add more ingredients, stopping when you're satisfied or the potion explodes (if you add too many things!).
* **Gambling Minigame:**  A `for` loop simulates dice rolls. The player can keep rolling until they “bust” (go over a certain number) or choose to stop.

**Mini-project: Expand Your RPG**

* **Upgrade Combat:** Use loops to make your combat more interesting. Introduce different monster types with varying health, and maybe the option to flee!
* **Crafting System:**  Use a `for` loop for recipes. The player needs to find all the ingredients in their inventory (a list). 

**Important Notes**

* **Indentation Matters!** Code inside the loop needs to be indented correctly, or it won't run as part of the loop.
* **Infinite Loops: Danger!**  If your `while` loop's condition is never False, it will run forever.  Make sure there's a way out!
