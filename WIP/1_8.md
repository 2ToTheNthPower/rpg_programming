**1.8 Simple Debugging Techniques**

**Even Heroes Make Mistakes (Your Code Will Too)**

Every programmer makes coding errors – they're part of the adventure! Debugging is the skill of tracking down those pesky problems,  like hunting down a bug-eyed monster hidden in your code.

**Common Errors You May Encounter**

* **SyntaxError:** You broke Python's grammar rules (mismatched parentheses, a missing colon, etc.) Python will yell with a message like this!
* **IndentationError:**  Your code blocks aren't lined up properly (`if` and `else` need those indents).
* **NameError:**  You used a variable that doesn't exist yet (due to a typo, maybe?).
* **TypeError:** You tried to do something impossible, like adding a number and a string.

**Debugging Strategies**

1. **Don't Panic!** Error messages look scary, but they often hold clues to fix the problem. 
2. **Read Carefully:**  See if the error message points to a specific line number.
3. **Rubber Duck Debugging:**  Explain your code aloud, line by line, even to a rubber duck or a pet.  Sometimes just saying it out loud helps the solution appear!
4. **The Power of Print:**  Add `print()` statements to see the values of your variables at different points. Example:
   ```python
   print("Health before battle:", health) 
   # ... battle code ...
   print("Health after battle:", health)
   ```
5. **Ask for Help:**  There are amazing  online communities to help you. But describe your problem clearly and what you've tried so far.

**RPG Tip: Test Often**

Just as a warrior tests their sword before battle, test your code in small steps! This makes errors easier to catch.

**Mini-project: Bug Hunt**

* **Purposely introduce a few errors into your RPG code:** A missing colon, a misspelled variable name, etc.
* **Play detective:** Try to find and fix them using the error messages and your debugging strategies.

**Remember:**

* **Bugs are a normal part of programming:**  Even the best programmers encounter them. 
* **Persistence is key:**  Don't get discouraged –  the feeling of squashing a bug is super rewarding!

**Next Time:** We'll look at how to write conditional statements ('if' and 'else') to give your code decision-making abilities.
