**1.6 Comments and Code Documentation**

**Secret Messages... For Yourself!**

Code can get confusing, even for the person who wrote it a week ago! That's where comments come in. They are notes left in your code that Python ignores when running your program.

**Types of Comments:**

* **Single-line Comments:** Start with `#`  
    ```python
    level = 5  # Player has reached level 5
    ``` 
* **Multi-line Comments:**  Use triple quotes (''' or """). Great for longer explanations: 
    ```python
    '''
    This section of code handles calculating experience points
    based on the monster's strength.
    '''
    ```

**Why Comment?**

* **Remember Your Plan:** Comments explain *why* you did something, not just *what* the code does. 
* **RPG Example:**  Mark where you want special events to trigger later ("# Add a treasure chest find here").
* **Collaborate (Even with Future You):** Comments let others (or your future self) understand your code faster.
* **Debugging:** Comment out bits of code to help find bugs.

**Docstrings: Special Comments for Functions**

We'll learn more about functions later, but for a sneak peek,  docstrings use triple quotes right inside a function:

```python
def calculate_damage(strength):
    """Calculates the total damage a character can do.

    Args:
        strength: The character's strength stat.

    Returns:
        The total damage value.
   """
   # ... rest of the function code 
```

These can become automated help guides!

**Mini-Project:  A Commented Quest**

* Go back to your character creation code. Add comments explaining each step.
* Imagine a simple quest. Use comments to outline the steps you would need code for ("# Check if player has the key")

**Key Points**

* **Don't Over-Comment:** Too many comments clutter your code. Focus on the tricky or important parts.
* **Plain Language:** Write your comments so that even a non-programmer could understand the idea.
