**Section 6: Saving Your Hero's Progress – The Power of Persistence!**

**Even Heroes Need to Rest (And Save Their Game)**

Imagine your brave adventurer finally reaching the lair of the evil dragon, only to be called away for dinner!  Don't worry – we can teach your program to remember your hero's progress.

**Saving with JSON**

JSON is like a notebook with easy-to-read entries, perfect for storing game data.  Python has a built-in `json` library:

```python
import json
```

**Example (Saving):**

```python
def save_game():
    game_data = {
        "player_level": player_level, 
        "player_health": player_health,
        "inventory": inventory
    }
    with open("save_file.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(game_data, f)  
```

**Loading Your Game**

```python
def load_game():
    with open("save_file.json", "r") as f:
        game_data = json.load(f)
    player_level = game_data["player_level"]
    # ... load other data similarly ...
```

**RPG Considerations**

* **What to Save:**  Player stats, inventory, quest progress, maybe even the state of the game world (which chests are open, etc.).
* **When to Save:**
   *  At checkpoints (like entering a town).
   *  Let the player save manually, especially before big decisions or battles.

**Mini-project:  Let Your Hero Rest Easy**

* **Implement a Basic Save:** Write a `save_game()` function to save the player's level, health, and inventory into a JSON file.
* **Add Load Functionality:** Write a `load_game()` function to restore the player's state from your save file. 

**Why JSON Is Great for Beginners**

* **Readable:** JSON looks clean, making it easy to find and fix errors.
* **Universal:** Many other programming languages use JSON too, so your save files could even work with a web-based version of your game (advanced!)

**Next Time: Object oriented programming**
