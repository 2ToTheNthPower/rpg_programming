**1.7 Basic Input and Output**

**Your Program Joins the Adventure!**

So far, you've taught your program to say things and store information. Now, let's make it a proper conversation where your program can ask questions and change what it does based on your answers.

**Review: The Power of `input()`**

* Remember, `input()` lets you ask the player a question and stores their answer as a string.
   ```python
   answer = input("Do you want to open the mysterious chest? (yes/no): ")
   ```

**Level Up Your Output with `print()`**

*  You can use `print()` to display messages, results of calculations, and more.
*  String formatting (f-strings or `.format()`) helps create dynamic output that changes based on player action.

 **RPG Challenge:  A Crossroads**

```python
path_choice = input("You reach a fork in the road. Go left or right? ")

if path_choice == "left":
    print("You stumble upon a hidden waterfall!")
else:
    print("You encounter a grumpy troll!") 
```

**Mini-Project: Enhance Your Adventure**

* Expand the crossroads choice. Add more detailed descriptions for each path.
* Introduce items or treasure with more input choices ("Do you take the shiny gem?")

**Important Reminders:**

* **Data Types Matter:**  If you need to compare a number, remember that `input()` always gives you a string to start. You might need to turn it into a number with `int()` or `float()`.
* **Indentation Counts:**  Code blocks inside `if` or `else` need to be indented to work correctly!

**Debugging Tip**

Use `print()` statements to check the values of variables at different points in your code. This helps you track down mistakes! For example:

```python
print("The player typed:", path_choice)  # Did they type "left" correctly?
```
